<l n="tr">When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field,</l>
<l n="tr">Their armies broken, and their courage quell'd,</l>
<l n="tr">Himself become the mark of public spite,</l>
<l n="tr">His honor question'd for the promis'd fight;</l>
<l n="tr">The more he was with vulgar hate oppress'd,</l>
<l n="tr">The more his fury boil'd within his breast:</l>
<l n="tr">He rous'd his vigor for the last debate,</l>
<l n="tr">And rais'd his haughty soul to meet his fate.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase,</l>
<l n="tr">He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace;</l>
<l n="tr">But, if the pointed jav'lin pierce his side,</l>
<l n="tr">The lordly beast returns with double pride:</l>
<l n="tr">He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain;</l>
<l n="tr">His sides he lashes, and erects his mane:</l>
<l n="tr">So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire,</l>
<l n="tr">Thro' his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Trembling with rage, around the court he ran,</l>
<l n="tr">At length approach'd the king, and thus began:</l>
<l n="tr">“No more excuses or delays: I stand</l>
<l n="tr">In arms prepar'd to combat, hand to hand,</l>
<l n="tr">This base deserter of his native land.</l>
<l n="tr">The Trojan, by his word, is bound to take</l>
<l n="tr">The same conditions which himself did make.</l>
<l n="tr">Renew the truce; the solemn rites prepare,</l>
<l n="tr">And to my single virtue trust the war.</l>
<l n="tr">The Latians unconcern'd shall see the fight;</l>
<l n="tr">This arm unaided shall assert your right:</l>
<l n="tr">Then, if my prostrate body press the plain,</l>
<l n="tr">To him the crown and beauteous bride remain.”</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="18" unit="card"/>To whom the king sedately thus replied:</l>
<l n="tr">“Brave youth, the more your valor has been tried,</l>
<l n="tr">The more becomes it us, with due respect,</l>
<l n="tr">To weigh the chance of war, which you neglect.</l>
<l n="tr">You want not wealth, or a successive throne,</l>
<l n="tr">Or cities which your arms have made your own:</l>
<l n="tr">My towns and treasures are at your command,</l>
<l n="tr">And stor'd with blooming beauties is my land;</l>
<l n="tr">Laurentum more than one <persName>Lavinia</persName> sees,</l>
<l n="tr">Unmarried, fair, of noble families.</l>
<l n="tr">Now let me speak, and you with patience hear,</l>
<l n="tr">Things which perhaps may grate a lover's ear,</l>
<l n="tr">But sound advice, proceeding from a heart</l>
<l n="tr">Sincerely yours, and free from fraudful art.</l>
<l n="tr">The gods, by signs, have manifestly shown,</l>
<l n="tr">No prince Italian born should heir my throne:</l>
<l n="tr">Oft have our augurs, in prediction skill'd,</l>
<l n="tr">And oft our priests, foreign son reveal'd.</l>
<l n="tr">Yet, won by worth that cannot be withstood,</l>
<l n="tr">Brib'd by my kindness to my kindred blood,</l>
<l n="tr">Urg'd by my wife, who would not be denied,</l>
<l n="tr">I promis'd my <persName>Lavinia</persName> for your bride:</l>
<l n="tr">Her from her plighted lord by force I took;</l>
<l n="tr">All ties of treaties, and of honor, broke:</l>
<l n="tr">On your account I wag'd an impious war—/L&gt;</l>
<l n="tr">With what success, 't is needless to declare;</l>
<l n="tr">I and my subjects feel, and you have had your share.</l>
<l n="tr">Twice vanquish'd while in bloody fields we strive,</l>
<l n="tr">Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive:</l>
<l n="tr">The rolling flood runs warm with human gore;</l>
<l n="tr">The bones of Latians blanch the neighb'ring shore.</l>
<l n="tr">Why put I not an end to this debate,</l>
<l n="tr">Still unresolv'd, and still a slave to fate?</l>
<l n="tr">If Turnus' death a lasting peace can give,</l>
<l n="tr">Why should I not procure it whilst you live?</l>
<l n="tr">Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray,</l>
<l n="tr">What would my kinsmen the Rutulians say?</l>
<l n="tr">And, should you fall in fight, (which Heav'n defend!)</l>
<l n="tr">How curse the cause which hasten'd to his end</l>
<l n="tr">The daughter's lover and the father's friend?</l>
<l n="tr">Weigh in your mind the various chance of war;</l>
<l n="tr">Pity your parent's age, and ease his care.”</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Such balmy words he pour'd, but all in vain:</l>
<l n="tr">The proffer'd med'cine but provok'd the pain.</l>
<l n="tr">The wrathful youth, disdaining the relief,</l>
<l n="tr">With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief:</l>
<l n="tr">“The care, O best of fathers, which you take</l>
<l n="tr">For my concerns, at my desire forsake.</l>
<l n="tr">Permit me not to languish out my days,</l>
<l n="tr">But make the best exchange of life for praise.</l>
<l n="tr">This arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize;</l>
<l n="tr">And the blood follows, where the weapon flies.</l>
<l n="tr">His goddess mother is not near, to shroud</l>
<l n="tr">The flying coward with an empty cloud.”</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="54" unit="card"/>But now the queen, who fear'd for Turnus' life,</l>
<l n="tr">And loath'd the hard conditions of the strife,</l>
<l n="tr">Held him by force; and, dying in his death,</l>
<l n="tr">In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath:</l>
<l n="tr">“O Turnus, I adjure thee by these tears,</l>
<l n="tr">And whate'er price Amata's honor bears</l>
<l n="tr">Within thy breast, since thou art all my hope,</l>
<l n="tr">My sickly mind's repose, my sinking age's prop;</l>
<l n="tr">Since on the safety of thy life alone</l>
<l n="tr">Depends Latinus, and the Latian throne:</l>
<l n="tr">Refuse me not this one, this only pray'r,</l>
<l n="tr">To waive the combat, and pursue the war.</l>
<l n="tr">Whatever chance attends this fatal strife,</l>
<l n="tr">Think it includes, in thine, Amata's life.</l>
<l n="tr">I cannot live a slave, or see my throne</l>
<l n="tr">Usurp'd by strangers or a Trojan son.”</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>At this, a flood of tears <persName>Lavinia</persName> shed;</l>
<l n="tr">A crimson blush her beauteous face o'erspread,</l>
<l n="tr">Varying her cheeks by turns with white and red.</l>
<l n="tr">The driving colors, never at a stay,</l>
<l n="tr">Run here and there, and flush, and fade away.</l>
<l n="tr">Delightful change! Thus Indian iv'ry shows,</l>
<l n="tr">Which with the bord'ring paint of purple glows;</l>
<l n="tr">Or lilies damask'd by the neighb'ring rose.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The lover gaz'd, and, burning with desire,</l>
<l n="tr">The more he look'd, the more he fed the fire:</l>
<l n="tr">Revenge, and jealous rage, and secret spite,</l>
<l n="tr">Roll in his breast, and rouse him to the fight.</l>
<l n="tr">Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes,</l>
<l n="tr">Firm to his first intent, he thus replies:</l>
<l n="tr">“O mother, do not by your tears prepare</l>
<l n="tr">Such boding omens, and prejudge the war.</l>
<l n="tr">Resolv'd on fight, I am no longer free</l>
<l n="tr">To shun my death, if Heav'n my death decree.”</l>
<l n="tr">Then turning to the herald, thus pursues:</l>
<l n="tr">“Go, greet the Trojan with ungrateful news;</l>
<l n="tr">Denounce from me, that, when to-morrow's light</l>
<l n="tr">Shall gild the heav'ns, he need not urge the fight;</l>
<l n="tr">The Trojan and Rutulian troops no more</l>
<l n="tr">Shall dye, with mutual blood, the Latian shore:</l>
<l n="tr">Our single swords the quarrel shall decide,</l>
<l n="tr">And to the victor be the beauteous bride.”</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="81" unit="card"/>He said, and striding on, with speedy pace,</l>
<l n="tr">He sought his coursers of the Thracian race.</l>
<l n="tr">At his approach they toss their heads on high,</l>
<l n="tr">And, proudly neighing, promise victory.</l>
<l n="tr">The sires of these Orythia sent from far,</l>
<l n="tr">To grace Pilumnus, when he went to war.</l>
<l n="tr">The drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor northern winds in fleetness match'd their flight.</l>
<l n="tr">Officious grooms stand ready by his side;</l>
<l n="tr">And some with combs their flowing manes divide,</l>
<l n="tr">And others stroke their chests and gently soothe their pride</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>He sheath'd his limbs in arms; a temper'd mass</l>
<l n="tr">Of golden metal those, and mountain brass.</l>
<l n="tr">Then to his head his glitt'ring helm he tied,</l>
<l n="tr">And girt his faithful fauchion to his side.</l>
<l n="tr">In his Aetnaean forge, the God of Fire</l>
<l n="tr">That fauchion labor'd for the hero's sire;</l>
<l n="tr">Immortal keenness on the blade bestow'd,</l>
<l n="tr">And plung'd it hissing in the Stygian flood.</l>
<l n="tr">Propp'd on a pillar, which the ceiling bore,</l>
<l n="tr">Was plac'd the lance Auruncan Actor wore;</l>
<l n="tr">Which with such force he brandish'd in his hand,</l>
<l n="tr">The tough ash trembled like an osier wand:</l>
<l n="tr">Then cried: “O pond'rous spoil of Actor slain,</l>
<l n="tr">And never yet by Turnus toss'd in vain,</l>
<l n="tr">Fail not this day thy wonted force; but go,</l>
<l n="tr">Sent by this hand, to pierce the Trojan foe!</l>
<l n="tr">Give me to tear his corslet from his breast,</l>
<l n="tr">And from that eunuch head to rend the crest;</l>
<l n="tr">Dragg'd in the dust, his frizzled hair to soil,</l>
<l n="tr">Hot from the vexing ir'n, and smear'd with fragrant oil!”</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thus while he raves, from his wide nostrils flies</l>
<l n="tr">A fiery steam, and sparkles from his eyes.</l>
<l n="tr">So fares the bull in his lov'd female's sight:</l>
<l n="tr">Proudly he bellows, and preludes the fight;</l>
<l n="tr">He tries his goring horns against a tree,</l>
<l n="tr">And meditates his absent enemy;</l>
<l n="tr">He pushes at the winds; he digs the strand</l>
<l n="tr">With his black hoofs, and spurns the yellow sand.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="107" unit="card"/>Nor less the Trojan, in his Lemnian arms,</l>
<l n="tr">To future fight his manly courage warms:</l>
<l n="tr">He whets his fury, and with joy prepares</l>
<l n="tr">To terminate at once the ling'ring wars;</l>
<l n="tr">To cheer his chiefs and tender son, relates</l>
<l n="tr">What Heav'n had promis'd, and expounds the fates.</l>
<l n="tr">Then to the Latian king he sends, to cease</l>
<l n="tr">The rage of arms, and ratify the peace.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="113" unit="card"/>The morn ensuing, from the mountain's height,</l>

<l n="tr">When now the Trojan and Rutulian guard,</l>

<l n="tr">Beneath the walls they measure out the space;</l>
<l n="tr">Then sacred altars rear, on sods of grass,</l>
<l n="tr">Where, with religious their common gods they place.</l>
<l n="tr">In purest white the priests their heads attire;</l>
<l n="tr">And living waters bear, and holy fire;</l>
<l n="tr">And, o'er their linen hoods and shaded hair,</l>
<l n="tr">Long twisted wreaths of sacred veryain wear,</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>In order issuing from the town appears</l>
<l n="tr">The Latin legion, arm'd with pointed spears;</l>
<l n="tr">And from the fields, advancing on a line,</l>

<l n="tr">Their various arms afford a pleasing sight;</l>
<l n="tr">A peaceful train they seem, in peace prepar'd for fight.</l>
<l n="tr">Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride,</l>

<l n="tr">Each man in order fills his proper place.</l>
<l n="tr">Reclining on their ample shields, they stand,</l>
<l n="tr">And fix their pointed lances in the sand.</l>
<l n="tr">Now, studious of the sight, a num'rous throng</l>
<l n="tr">Of either sex promiscuous, old and young,</l>
<l n="tr">Swarm the town: by those who rest behind,</l>
<l n="tr">The gates and walls and houses' tops are lin'd.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="134" unit="card"/>Meantime the Queen of Heav'n beheld the sight,</l>
  <l n="tr">With eyes unpleas'd, from <placeName key="tgn,1103685" authname="tgn,1103685">Mount Albano</placeName>'s height</l>

<l n="tr">Four steeds the chariot of Latinus bear;</l>
<l n="tr">Twelve golden beams around his temples play,</l>
<l n="tr">To mark his lineage from the God of Day.</l>
<l n="tr">Two snowy coursers Turnus' chariot yoke,</l>
<l n="tr">And in his hand two massy spears he shook:</l>
<l n="tr">Then issued from the camp, in arms divine,</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas, author of the Roman line;</l>
