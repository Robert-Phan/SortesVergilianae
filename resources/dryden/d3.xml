<l n="tr">When ruin'd <placeName key="perseus,Troy" authname="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> became the Grecians' prey,</l>

<l n="tr">With sighs and tears I leave my native shore,</l>

<l n="tr">A bull on Jove's imperial altar laid.</l>
<l n="tr">Not far, a rising hillock stood in view;</l>
<l n="tr">Sharp myrtles on the sides, and cornels grew.</l>
<l n="tr">There, while I went to crop the sylvan scenes,</l>

<l n="tr">Mann'd once again, another plant I try:</l>

<l n="tr">Then, fearing guilt for some offense unknown,</l>
<l n="tr">With pray'rs and vows the Dryads I atone,</l>

<l n="tr">To learn the cause, I tugged with all my strength:</l>

<l n="tr">The violated myrtle ran with gore.</l>
<l n="tr">Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb</l>
<l n="tr">Of wounded earth, and caverns of the tomb,</l>
<l n="tr">A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew'd</l>
<l n="tr">My fright, and then these dreadful words ensued:</l>

<l n="tr">My sire Anchises crown'd a cup with wine,</l>
<l n="tr">And, off'ring, thus implor'd the pow'rs divine:</l>
<l n="tr">‘Ye gods, presiding over lands and seas,</l>

<l n="tr">And smooth our passage to the port assign'd!’</l>
<l n="tr">The gentle gales their flagging force renew,</l>

<l n="tr">We furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore;</l>
<l n="tr">The curling waters round the galleys roar.</l>
<l n="tr">The land lies open to the raging east,</l>
<l n="tr">Then, bending like a bow, with rocks compress'd,</l>
<l n="tr">Shuts out the storms; the winds and waves complain,</l>
<l n="tr">And vent their malice on the cliffs in vain.</l>
<l n="tr">The port lies hid within; on either side</l>
<l n="tr">Two tow'ring rocks the narrow mouth divide.</l>
<l n="tr">The temple, which aloft we view'd before,</l>
<l n="tr">To distance flies, and seems to shun the shore.</l>
<l n="tr">Scarce landed, the first omens I beheld</l>
<l n="tr">Were four white steeds that cropp'd the flow'ry field.</l>
<l n="tr">‘War, war is threaten'd from this foreign ground,’</l>
<l n="tr">My father cried, ‘where warlike steeds are found.</l>
<l n="tr">Yet, since reclaim'd to chariots they submit,</l>

<l n="tr">Peace may succeed to war.’ Our way we bend</l>
<l n="tr">To Pallas, and the sacred hill ascend;</l>
<l n="tr">There prostrate to the fierce virago pray,</l>
<l n="tr">Whose temple was the landmark of our way.</l>
<l n="tr">Each with a Phrygian mantle veil'd his head,</l>
<l n="tr">And all commands of Helenus obey'd,</l>
<l n="tr">And pious rites to Grecian Juno paid.</l>
<l n="tr">These dues perform'd, we stretch our sails, and stand</l>
